# Project Euler Problem 31: Coin sums
# https://projecteuler.net/problem=31
# 
# In the United Kingdom the currency is made up of pound (£) and pence (p). 
# There are eight coins in general circulation:1p, 2p, 5p, 10p, 20p, 50p, £1 
# (100p), and £2 (200p). It is possible to make £2 in the following way:1×£1 + 
# 1×50p + 2×20p + 1×5p + 1×2p + 3×1pHow many different ways can £2 be made 
# using any number of coins?
