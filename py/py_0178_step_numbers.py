# Project Euler Problem 178: Step Numbers
# https://projecteuler.net/problem=178
# 
# Consider the number 45656. It can be seen that each pair of consecutive 
# digits of 45656 has a difference of one. A number for which every pair of 
# consecutive digits has a difference of one is called a step number. A 
# pandigital number contains every decimal digit from 0 to 9 at least once. 
# How many pandigital step numbers less than 1040 are there?
