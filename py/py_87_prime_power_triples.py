# Solution of;
# Project Euler Problem 87: Prime power triples
# https://projecteuler.net/problem=87
# 
# The smallest number expressible as the sum of a prime square, prime cube, 
# and prime fourth power is 28. In fact, there are exactly four numbers below 
# fifty that can be expressed in such a way:28 = 22 + 23 + 2433 = 32 + 23 + 
# 2449 = 52 + 23 + 2447 = 22 + 33 + 24How many numbers below fifty million can 
# be expressed as the sum of a prime square, prime cube, and prime fourth 
# power?
