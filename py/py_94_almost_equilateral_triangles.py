# Solution of;
# Project Euler Problem 94: Almost equilateral triangles
# https://projecteuler.net/problem=94
# 
# It is easily proved that no equilateral triangle exists with integral length 
# sides and integral area. However, the almost equilateral triangle 5-5-6 has 
# an area of 12 square units. We shall define an almost equilateral triangle 
# to be a triangle for which two sides are equal and the third differs by no 
# more than one unit. Find the sum of the perimeters of all almost equilateral 
# triangles with integral side lengths and area and whose perimeters do not 
# exceed one billion (1,000,000,000).
