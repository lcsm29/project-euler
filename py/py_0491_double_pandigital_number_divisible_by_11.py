# Project Euler Problem 491: Double pandigital number divisible by 11
# https://projecteuler.net/problem=491
# 
# We call a positive integer double pandigital if it uses all the digits 0 to 
# 9 exactly twice (with no leading zero). For example, 40561817703823564929 is 
# one such number. How many double pandigital numbers are divisible by 11?
