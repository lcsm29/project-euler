# Solution of;
# Project Euler Problem 78: Coin partitions
# https://projecteuler.net/problem=78
# 
# Let p(n) represent the number of different ways in which n coins can be 
# separated into piles. For example, five coins can be separated into piles in 
# exactly seven different ways, so p(5)=7. OOOOOOOOO OOOO OOOOO O OOO OO OOO O 
# O OO O O O OFind the least value of n for which p(n) is divisible by one 
# million.
