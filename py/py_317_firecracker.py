# Solution of;
# Project Euler Problem 317: Firecracker
# https://projecteuler.net/problem=317
# 
# A firecracker explodes at a height of 100 m above level ground. It breaks 
# into a large number of very small fragments, which move in every direction; 
# all of them have the same initial velocity of 20 m/s. We assume that the 
# fragments move without air resistance, in a uniform gravitational field with 
# g=9. 81 m/s2. Find the volume (in m3) of the region through which the 
# fragments move before reaching the ground. Give your answer rounded to four 
# decimal places.
