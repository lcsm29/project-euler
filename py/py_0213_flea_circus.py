# Project Euler Problem 213: Flea Circus
# https://projecteuler.net/problem=213
# 
# A 30Ã—30 grid of squares contains 900 fleas, initially one flea per square. 
# When a bell is rung, each flea jumps to an adjacent square at random 
# (usually 4 possibilities, except for fleas on the edge of the grid or at the 
# corners). What is the expected number of unoccupied squares after 50 rings 
# of the bell? Give your answer rounded to six decimal places.
