# Solution of;
# Project Euler Problem 454: Diophantine reciprocals III
# https://projecteuler.net/problem=454
# 
# In the following equation x, y, and n are positive integers. $$\dfrac{1}{x} 
# + \dfrac{1}{y} = \dfrac{1}{n}$$For a limit L we define F(L) as the number of 
# solutions which satisfy x < y â‰¤ L. We can verify that F(15) = 4 and F(1000) 
# = 1069. Find F(1012).
