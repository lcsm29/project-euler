# Solution of;
# Project Euler Problem 22: Names scores
# https://projecteuler.net/problem=22
# 
# Using names.txt, a 46K text file containing over five-thousand first names,
# begin by sorting it into alphabetical order. Then working out the 
# alphabetical value for each name, multiply this value by its alphabetical 
# position in the list to obtain a name score. 
# 
# For example, when the list is sorted into alphabetical order, COLIN, 
# which is worth 3 + 15 + 12 + 9 + 14 = 53, is the 938th name in the list.
# So, COLIN would obtain a score of 938 Ã— 53 = 49714. 
# 
# What is the total of all the name scores in the file?
