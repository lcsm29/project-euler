# Project Euler Problem 41: Pandigital prime
# https://projecteuler.net/problem=41
# 
# We shall say that an n-digit number is pandigital if it makes use of all the 
# digits 1 to n exactly once. For example, 2143 is a 4-digit pandigital and is 
# also prime. What is the largest n-digit pandigital prime that exists?
