# Solution of;
# Project Euler Problem 60: Prime pair sets
# https://projecteuler.net/problem=60
# 
# The primes 3, 7, 109, and 673, are quite remarkable. By taking any two 
# primes and concatenating them in any order the result will always be prime. 
# For example, taking 7 and 109, both 7109 and 1097 are prime. The sum of 
# these four primes, 792, represents the lowest sum for a set of four primes 
# with this property. Find the lowest sum for a set of five primes for which 
# any two primes concatenate to produce another prime.
