# Project Euler Problem 34: Digit factorials
# https://projecteuler.net/problem=34
# 
# 145 is a curious number, as 1! + 4! + 5! = 1 + 24 + 120 = 145. Find the sum 
# of all numbers which are equal to the sum of the factorial of their digits. 
# Note: As 1! = 1 and 2! = 2 are not sums they are not included.
