# Project Euler Problem 50: Consecutive prime sum
# https://projecteuler.net/problem=50
# 
# The prime 41, can be written as the sum of six consecutive primes:41 = 2 + 3 
# + 5 + 7 + 11 + 13This is the longest sum of consecutive primes that adds to 
# a prime below one-hundred. The longest sum of consecutive primes below 
# one-thousand that adds to a prime, contains 21 terms, and is equal to 953. 
# Which prime, below one-million, can be written as the sum of the most
