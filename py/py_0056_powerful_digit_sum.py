# Solution of;
# Project Euler Problem 56: Powerful digit sum
# https://projecteuler.net/problem=56
# 
# A googol (10100) is a massive number: one followed by one-hundred zeros; 
# 100100 is almost unimaginably large: one followed by two-hundred zeros. 
# Despite their size, the sum of the digits in each number is only 1. 
# Considering natural numbers of the form, ab, where a, b < 100, what is the 
# maximum digital sum?
