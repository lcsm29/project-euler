# Project Euler Problem 348: Sum of a square and a cube
# https://projecteuler.net/problem=348
# 
# Many numbers can be expressed as the sum of a square and a cube. Some of 
# them in more than one way. Consider the palindromic numbers that can be 
# expressed as the sum of a square and a cube, both greater than 1, in exactly 
# 4 different ways. For example, 5229225 is a palindromic number and it can be 
# expressed in exactly 4 different ways:22852 + 20322232 + 66318102 + 
# 125311972 + 1563 Find the sum of the five smallest such palindromic numbers.
