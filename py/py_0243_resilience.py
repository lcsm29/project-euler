# Solution of;
# Project Euler Problem 243: Resilience
# https://projecteuler.net/problem=243
# 
# A positive fraction whose numerator is less than its denominator is called a 
# proper fraction. For any denominator, d, there will be dâˆ’1 proper fractions; 
# for example, with d = 12:1/12 , 2/12 , 3/12 , 4/12 , 5/12 , 6/12 , 7/12 , 
# 8/12 , 9/12 , 10/12 , 11/12 . We shall call a fraction that cannot be 
# cancelled down a resilient fraction. Furthermore we shall define the 
# resilience of a denominator, R(d), to be the ratio of its proper fractions 
# that are resilient; for example, R(12) = 4/11 . In fact, d = 12 is the 
# smallest denominator having a resilience R(d) < 4/10 . Find the smallest 
# denominator d, having a resilience R(d) < 15499/94744 .
