# Project Euler Problem 117: Red, green, and blue tiles
# https://projecteuler.net/problem=117
# 
# Using a combination of grey square tiles and oblong tiles chosen from: red 
# tiles (measuring two units), green tiles (measuring three units), and blue 
# tiles (measuring four units), it is possible to tile a row measuring five 
# units in length in exactly fifteen different ways. How many ways can a row 
# measuring fifty units in length be tiled?NOTE: This is related to Problem 
# 116.
