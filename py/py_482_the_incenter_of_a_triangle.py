# Solution of;
# Project Euler Problem 482: The incenter of a triangle
# https://projecteuler.net/problem=482
# 
# ABC is an integer sided triangle with incenter I and perimeter p. The 
# segments IA, IB and IC have integral length as well. Let L = p + |IA| + |IB| 
# + |IC|. Let S(P) = ∑ L for all such triangles where p ≤ P. For example, 
# S(103) = 3619. Find S(107).
