# Solution of;
# Project Euler Problem 235: An Arithmetic Geometric sequence
# https://projecteuler.net/problem=235
# 
# Given is the arithmetic-geometric sequence u(k) = (900-3k)rk-1. Let s(n) = 
# Î£k=1. . . nu(k). Find the value of r for which s(5000) = -600,000,000,000. 
# Give your answer rounded to 12 places behind the decimal point.
