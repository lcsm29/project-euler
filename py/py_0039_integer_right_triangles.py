# Solution of;
# Project Euler Problem 39: Integer right triangles
# https://projecteuler.net/problem=39
# 
# If p is the perimeter of a right angle triangle with integral length sides, 
# {a,b,c}, there are exactly three solutions for p = 120. {20,48,52}, 
# {24,45,51}, {30,40,50}For which value of p â‰¤ 1000, is the number of 
# solutions maximised?
