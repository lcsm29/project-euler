# Project Euler Problem 4: Largest palindrome product
# https://projecteuler.net/problem=4
# 
# A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made 
# from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99. Find the largest 
# palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.
