# Project Euler Problem 359: Hilbert's New Hotel
# https://projecteuler.net/problem=359
# 
# An infinite number of people (numbered 1, 2, 3, etc. ) are lined up to get a 
# room at Hilbert's newest infinite hotel. The hotel contains an infinite 
# number of floors (numbered 1, 2, 3, etc. ), and each floor contains an 
# infinite number of rooms (numbered 1, 2, 3, etc. ). Initially the hotel is 
# empty. Hilbert declares a rule on how the nth person is assigned a room: 
# person n gets the first vacant room in the lowest numbered floor satisfying 
# either of the following:the floor is emptythe floor is not empty, and if the 
# latest person taking a room in that floor is person m, then m + n is a 
# perfect squarePerson 1 gets room 1 in floor 1 since floor 1 is empty. Person 
# 2 does not get room 2 in floor 1 since 1 + 2 = 3 is not a perfect square. 
# Person 2 instead gets room 1 in floor 2 since floor 2 is empty. Person 3 
# gets room 2 in floor 1 since 1 + 3 = 4 is a perfect square. Eventually, 
# every person in the line gets a room in the hotel. Define P(f, r) to be n if 
# person n occupies room r in floor f, and 0 if no person occupies the room. 
# Here are a few examples:P(1, 1) = 1P(1, 2) = 3P(2, 1) = 2P(10, 20) = 
# 440P(25, 75) = 4863P(99, 100) = 19454Find the sum of all P(f, r) for all 
# positive f and r such that f Ã— r = 71328803586048 and give the last 8 digits 
# as your answer.
